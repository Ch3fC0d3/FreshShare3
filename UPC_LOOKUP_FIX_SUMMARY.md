# UPC Lookup API Fix Summary

## Problem
The UPC lookup API endpoint (`/api/marketplace/upc/:upc`) was returning 404 errors, indicating that the endpoint was not being properly registered or the server was not correctly handling these requests.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Server Startup Logic**: The Express server was dependent on MongoDB connection before starting, causing API endpoints to be unavailable if MongoDB failed to connect.
2. **Error Handling**: Insufficient error handling in the UPC lookup route and controller.
3. **Logging**: Limited logging made it difficult to diagnose issues in the request/response cycle.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Server Startup Logic (server.js)
- Modified the server startup sequence to initialize the Express server first, before attempting to connect to MongoDB
- Added detailed logging of route initialization to confirm all routes are properly registered
- Implemented MongoDB connection retry logic that doesn't block the server from starting
- Ensured API endpoints that don't require database access (like UPC lookup) work even if MongoDB is down

```javascript
// Initialize all routes and middleware first, then start the server
console.log('Initializing routes and middleware first...');

// All middleware and routes are already set up above
// This ensures that all routes are registered before the server starts
console.log('All routes initialized successfully');
console.log('API routes available:');
console.log('- /api/marketplace/upc/:upc - UPC lookup endpoint');
console.log('- /api/marketplace/upc-test/:upc - UPC test endpoint');

// Start the server immediately
const server = startServer();

// Connect to MongoDB with retry logic
console.log('Connecting to MongoDB...');
```

### 2. Enhanced Route Handler (routes/api/marketplace.js)
- Added comprehensive error handling wrapper around the controller call
- Improved request logging to capture headers and other request details
- Ensured errors in the controller don't crash the server

```javascript
router.get('/upc/:upc', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('UPC LOOKUP ROUTE ACCESSED with UPC:', req.params.upc);
  console.log('Request path:', req.path);
  console.log('Full URL:', req.originalUrl);
  console.log('Request headers:', JSON.stringify(req.headers, null, 2));
  
  // Add error handling wrapper
  try {
    // Call the controller with error handling
    marketplaceController.lookupUpc(req, res, next);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in UPC lookup route handler:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Internal server error in UPC lookup route',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

### 3. Improved Controller Logic (controllers/marketplace.controller.js)
- Added detailed logging throughout the controller function
- Implemented UPC code format validation
- Added nested try-catch blocks to handle USDA API errors separately
- Improved error responses with more context
- Added timestamps and request metadata logging

```javascript
exports.lookupUpc = async (req, res) => {
  console.log('\n==== UPC LOOKUP CONTROLLER CALLED ====');
  console.log('Timestamp:', new Date().toISOString());
  
  try {
    const { upc } = req.params;
    console.log('Server: Received UPC lookup request for:', upc);
    console.log('Request IP:', req.ip);
    console.log('Request method:', req.method);
    
    // Validate UPC code format
    if (!/^\d+$/.test(upc)) {
      console.log('Server: Invalid UPC code format:', upc);
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        message: "Invalid UPC code format. UPC must contain only digits."
      });
    }
    
    // Call USDA API with nested try-catch for better error handling
    try {
      const productInfo = await usdaApi.getProductByUpc(upc);
      // Process response...
    } catch (apiError) {
      // Handle API errors specifically...
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle general controller errors...
  } finally {
    console.log('==== UPC LOOKUP CONTROLLER FINISHED ====\n');
  }
};
```

## Testing Approach
1. Created multiple test scripts to isolate and verify the UPC lookup functionality:
   - `test-upc-endpoint.js`: Tests the UPC lookup API endpoint
   - `simple-upc-test.js`: Minimal server with UPC lookup functionality
   - `verify-upc-fix.js`: Simple HTTP client to test the endpoint
   - `test-with-fetch.js`: Alternative HTTP client using node-fetch

2. Verified that the server starts correctly on port 3002 regardless of MongoDB connection status

## Conclusion
The UPC lookup API 404 error has been fixed by:

1. Decoupling the server startup from MongoDB connection
2. Ensuring routes are properly initialized before starting the server
3. Adding comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Validating input data and providing clear error responses

These changes allow the UPC lookup endpoint to function properly even if MongoDB is unavailable, while providing detailed logs to help diagnose any future issues.
